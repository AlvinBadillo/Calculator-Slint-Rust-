iOS-Like Calculator Program
This is an iOS-inspired calculator program implemented in Rust for logic and using Slint for the UI.

Overview
This project aims to replicate the functionality and aesthetics of the standard iOS calculator application using Rust for the backend logic and Slint for the user interface. 
By combining the power and efficiency of Rust with the sleekness of Slint, we've created a user-friendly calculator application that can be easily extended and modified.

Features
- iOS-inspired Design: The user interface closely resembles the standard iOS calculator, providing users with a familiar and intuitive experience.
- Efficient Rust Logic: The calculator's core logic is implemented in Rust, leveraging its performance and safety features.
- Slint UI Library: The user interface is built using Slint, a lightweight and flexible UI library for Rust.
- Basic Arithmetic Operations: Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
 -Clear and Error Handling: Includes functionality to clear the current input or handle errors gracefully.
