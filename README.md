I’ve developed an iOS look-a-like calculator. I’ve used Slint to implement the UI of the application while the logic of it was done using Rust. I’ve added all the basic functionalities of a regular calculator (+, -, *, /). Other features include clear, change sign, and percent functionalities, it also works with decimal numbers. For the UI, I arranged several grids, rectangles, and text messages to recreate the iOS calculator UI. As for the logic, I took a conditional approach where I defined multiple variables to determine the current state of the calculator and based on those, it will choose what path to execute.
